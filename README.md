## Project Overview
The dashboard features an overview of key customer ratings, including cabin staff service, entertainment, food, ground service, seat comfort, and value for money. Through interactive visualizations and filters, users can explore trends over time, regional differences, and preferences based on traveler types, seat classes, and aircraft models.

## Key Metrics
The project highlights critical customer feedback metrics:
- Average ratings for services such as cabin staff, food, and entertainment.
- A breakdown of customer satisfaction across various aircraft types and seat classes.
- Trends in service ratings over time from March 2016 to October 2023.

## Dashboard Features
The dashboard includes:

1. Interactive Visualizations:
- A line chart showing average cabin staff service ratings by month.
- A map visualization of average ratings by country.
- Bar charts displaying service ratings by aircraft type and the number of reviews.
2. Dynamic Filters:
- A metric picker to focus on specific areas of customer experience.
- Date range sliders to filter reviews by custom time periods.
- Filters for traveler types (e.g., business, family leisure) and seat types (e.g., business class, economy class).
- A continent filter to examine regional trends.

 ## Key Insights
The analysis reveals several important insights. Cabin staff service ratings have fluctuated over the years, with First Class and Premium Economy receiving the highest scores. Regional differences show varying levels of satisfaction, while certain aircraft, such as the Boeing 787, performed particularly well in terms of customer feedback. Family Leisure travelers consistently rated cabin staff service highly, demonstrating the importance of customer segmentation in service evaluation.

## Recommendations and Improvements
Integrating real-time data into the dashboard would enhance its relevance and provide actionable insights for current business decisions. Adding predictive analytics, such as forecasting customer satisfaction trends, could further improve the utility of the dashboard. Enhanced drill-down capabilities, allowing users to explore granular details, would make the dashboard even more interactive and insightful.

## Limitations
The dataset is static and does not include real-time updates, which might limit its application to ongoing scenarios. Subjective customer reviews may introduce bias, and the data does not represent all flights or demographics, which could impact the generalizability of findings. Manual data cleaning and transformation processes may also introduce errors.
